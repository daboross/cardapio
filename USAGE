To use as a panel applet, simply add it as usual: Right-click the panel, select
"Add to panel", then choose "Cardapio".

To use as a launcher, run cardapio with the argument 'show'. That is:
$ cardapio show

Once cardapio is running, you can access it using Super+Space. To change this
key binding and to access many more options, simply change the file at
~/.config/Cardapio/config.ini which is created automatically when Cardapio
*exits*.

Have fun!


Note
====

This is version 0.9, which means there are some bugs. For instance, window
managers tend to stop Cardapio from gaining focus when the key binding is used.
As a quick fix, just add Cardapio to your window manager's exception list. This
and other bugs will be fixed before 1.0.

If you would like to contribute, take a look at the lines marked with "TODO" in
cardapio.py
