Usage
=====

To use as a panel applet, simply add it as usual: Right-click the panel, select
"Add to panel", then choose "Cardapio".

To use as a launcher, run cardapio with the argument 'hidden'. That is:
$ cardapio hidden 

Once cardapio is running, you can access it using Super+Space. To change this
key binding and to access many more options, simply change the file at
~/.config/Cardapio/config.ini which is created automatically when Cardapio
*exits*.

Have fun!


For power-users: If you would like to make a shortcut somewhere that will show a hidden instance
of Cardapio, just point it to "cardapio show".


Note
====

Although Cardapio is in a VERY stable state right now, this version has been
marked as 0.9.x, which means there are still some bugs and missing features.

These are marked in the source file cardapio.py with the "TODO" headings. Some
are marked as blocking the release of version 1.0. If you would like to
contribute, please consider starting with those!
