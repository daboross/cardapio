Usage
=====

To use as a Gnome2 panel applet, simply add it as usual: Right-click the panel,
select "Add to panel", then choose "Cardapio".


To use in Gnome3 FallBack mode, drag and drop cardapio icon from Applications menu onto Gnome Panel.
(Currently this is the only way to use it in Gnome3 FallBack mode, but this will change soon)


To use as a launcher, run cardapio with the argument 'hidden'. That is:
$ cardapio hidden 


To use in Docky, open Docky's settings window, click on the Helpers tab, select
Cardapio and click on the right-most button that appears on its
row (the button has no label, but its tooltip is "enable this helper").
That's it! From now on, when you click the "anchor" icon you will cause Cardapio to pop up.


To use in AWN, open Avant Window Navigator's settings window, choose applets,
and drag Cardapio from "Available Applets" to "Active Applets".
That's it!


Once cardapio is running, you can access it using Super+Space. To change this
key binding and to access many more options, simply change the file at
~/.config/Cardapio/config.ini which is created automatically when Cardapio
*exits*.


Have fun!


Note
====

For power-users: If you would like to make a shortcut somewhere that will show a hidden instance
of Cardapio, just point it to "cardapio show".

Although Cardapio is in a VERY stable state right now, this version has been
marked as 0.9.x, which means there are still some bugs and missing features.

These are marked in the source file cardapio.py with the "TODO" headings. Some
are marked as blocking the release of version 1.0. If you would like to
contribute, please consider starting with those!
