Description: Cardapio extension for Gnome Shell
 Cardapio is a launcher that can work in two modes: as a panel applet 
 (in which case it is an alternative to Gnome's application menu 
 applet) or as a launcher (in which case it is a lightweight 
 alternative to Gnome Do). Either way, it features a beautiful, 
 well-thought-out interface, supports tracker searching, and much more. 
 Give it a try today! 
 .
 This package installs a Gnome Shell extension that lets you easily add
 Cardapio to your Gnome Shell top panel.
