Description: An alternative Gnome menu applet, launcher, and much more!
 Cardapio is a launcher that can work in two modes: as a panel applet (in which
 case it is an alternative to Gnome's application menu applet) or as a launcher
 (in which case it is a lightweight alternative to Gnome Do). Either way, it 
 features a beautiful, well-thought-out interface, supports tracker searching, 
 and much more. Give it a try today!
