Description: An alternative Gnome menu, launcher, and much more!
 Cardapio is a launcher that can work in two modes: as a panel applet 
 (in which case it is an alternative to Gnome's application menu 
 applet) or as a launcher (in which case it is a lightweight 
 alternative to Gnome Do). Either way, it features a beautiful, 
 well-thought-out interface, supports tracker searching, and much more. 
 Give it a try today!
